# Project Overview
  The main objective of this project is to analyze customer reviews from the Yelp dataset to uncover patterns and hidden insights that can inform business decisions. 
  Specifically, the focus is on businesses with more than 50 reviews, ensuring a substantial amount of customer feedback for analysis. Additionally, the project generates
  a concise summary of all reviews for each business, allowing business owners to quickly grasp the overall sentiment and key themes expressed by their customers at a glance 
  without needing to read through every individual review
  
This project focuses on:
- Preprocessing and cleaning reviews
  * Removing stopwords to reduce noise
  * Normalizing token frequencies
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Yelp reviews using box plots and 2D histogram contour plots
  * Understanding the distribution and variability of review lengths
  * Identifying correlations and outliers in sentence and word counts
- Scoring sentences based on token frequencies
- Extractive summarization of business reviews
